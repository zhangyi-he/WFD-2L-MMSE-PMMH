# Detecting and quantifying natural selection at two linked loci from time series data of allele frequencies with forward-in-time simulations
Source code is implemented for an MCMC-based method for inferring natural selection at two linked loci from time series data of allele frequencies through forward-in-time simulations, and the article has been published in Genetics available at https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.120.303463.

Code v1.0 includes the source code implemented for the case that missing values are not allowed.

Code v1.1 includes the source code implemented for the case that missing values are allowed.
