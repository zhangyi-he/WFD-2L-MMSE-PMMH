# Detecting and quantifying natural selection at two linked loci from time series data of allele frequencies with forward-in-time simulations
The source code is implemented for an MCMC-based method for inferring selection at two linked loci from time series data of allele frequencies through forward-in-time simulations, and the article has been published in Genetics, available at https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.120.303463.

[Code v1.0](https://github.com/zhangyi-he/WFM-2L-DiffusApprox-FwdPMMH/tree/master/Code%20v1.0) includes the source code implemented for the case that missing genotypes are not allowed.

[Code v1.1](https://github.com/zhangyi-he/WFM-2L-DiffusApprox-FwdPMMH/tree/master/Code%20v1.1) includes the source code implemented for the case that missing genotypes are allowed.
